## What is Trickster?

Trickster is a smart menu bar application that keeps track of your recently opened files and lets you access them in just one click. It works silently in the background, monitoring your activity across all applications, and presents a neatly organized list of documents, images, archives, and folders.

Ideal for power users, creatives, and professionals who handle multiple files throughout the day, Trickster eliminates the need to navigate through complex directory structures or rely on manual searches. The app supports advanced filtering by file type, date, and name, and allows you to pin essential items for permanent quick access.

With its native macOS design, Trickster feels like a built-in feature rather than a third-party tool. It integrates with system services such as Quick Look and Drag & Drop, and is fully compatible with the latest versions of macOS, including those running on M-series chips.

Beyond recent files, Trickster can also monitor folders for changes, display recently downloaded items, and even show files from connected drives. Its customizable appearance and behavior make it a versatile addition to any Mac user’s toolkit.
